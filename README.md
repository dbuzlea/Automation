# Automation

Consists of various automation examples (for learning puposes) and projects (UI testing) utilizing 
Selenium and PyAutoGUI frameworks for MacOS devices. 

Each test case or suite can be ran individually from Terminal, or you can run all test suites from the console_test_suites.py file.
Feel free to explore or submit any ideas via pull request! 

All programs were developed on a M1 13" MacBook Pro (2560 Ã— 1600)

# Requirements:

* Must be running macOS 13.0 or later 
* Because the UI testing relies on pyautogui display coordinates to navigate, System Settings window must be placed in the upper-left most corner of your screen in order for the tests to work (see image below).
